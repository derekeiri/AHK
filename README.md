# AutoHotKey Scripts

**_sumatra_PDF_sync.ahk_**

This is one way to synchronize scrolling between two PDF files open in SumatraPDF when not using tabs (Settings | Options - Adavanced) and two SumartraPDF windows are open. This was adapted from a script found in a [StackExchange post from ivanatpr dated 12/21/2011](https://superuser.com/questions/46123/how-to-compare-the-differences-between-two-pdf-files-on-windows).

The right arrow key navigates to the next page in both windows.  The left arrow key navigates to the previous page. 

If you use **Windows Spy** (packaged with AutoHotKey), you can identify the _ahk_class_ specific to your PDF viewer and edit the script.
